# Virtual Handpan Instrument

A virtual handpan instrument, made using the Web Audio API and built with plain HTML. It features a scale selector, pitch transposition and some navigsation that was left on the html page.
The project is based on the blues guitar project from https://css-tricks.com/introduction-web-audio-api/, and adapted to both the design and the needs of the virtual handpan project.
The project is now implemented on my webpage www.haganenote.com, our handpan-making project.
