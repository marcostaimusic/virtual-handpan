# Virtual Handpan Instrument

A virtual handpan instrument, made using the Web Audio API and built with plain HTML and Javascript. It features a scale selector, pitch transposition and some navigation made with Bootstrap that was left on the index.html. It is a multi-touch sample player, with the possibility to play on a smartphone touchscreen and using a computer keyboard. The samples were recorded from handpans we have made, and transposed with a DAW as far as some higher notes are concerned, to complete the high range of some scales.
The project is based on the blues guitar project from https://css-tricks.com/introduction-web-audio-api/, and adapted to both the design and the needs of the virtual handpan project.
The project is now implemented on my webpage www.haganenote.com, our handpan-making project.
